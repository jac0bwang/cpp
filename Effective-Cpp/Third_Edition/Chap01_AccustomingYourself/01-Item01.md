# Item 01: View C++ as a federation of languages

## C++ is multiparadigm programming language:
01. procedural
02. object-orientated
03. functional
04. generic
05. metaprogramming features

C++ is not a single language;
C++ is a federation of languages

01. C
02. Object-Orientated C++
03. Template C++
04. STL


## Pass by value	(C)
More efficient that pass by reference for built-in (C-like) types

## Pass by reference to const	(OO, Template)
* Better for **user-defined objects** (with constructors / destructors)
* Esp. true for template C++ (you don't know type you're dealing)

## Pass by value	(STL)
* Better for **STL** because iterators and function objects are modelled on pointers in C
* Iterators and function objects in STL pass by value is better

# Note
C++ 高效编程守则视状况变化，取决于你使用 C++ 的那一部分

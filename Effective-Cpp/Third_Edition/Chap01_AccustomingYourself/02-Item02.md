# Item 02: Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to #defines


## 1 Prefer compiler to the preprocessor

```
// ASPECT_RATIO Ã»ÓÐ±àÒë½ø·ûºÅ±í£¬ÎÞ·¨¶¨Î»ÎÊÌâ
//NO
#define ASPECT_RATIO 1.653

//YES
const double AspectRatio = 1.653;


//AspectRatio seen by compilers and entered into symbol tables

//Also 1.653 (#define) multiple times in object code
//Whereas constant AspectRatio appears once
```

## 2 SPECIAL CASES

### 2.1 Defining constant pointers

```
// ³£Á¿µÄÊ¹ÓÃ
//Constant definitions in headers files means pointer declared const plus what pointer points to
const char* const authorName = "Scott Meyers";

//NB: string prob better than char*
const std:: authorName("Scott Meyers");
```

### 2.2 Class-specific constants

* ÏÞÖÆ³£Á¿µÄ×÷ÓÃÓòÔÚ class ÖÐ£¬±ØÐë¶¨ÒåÎª class µÄÒ»¸ö³ÉÔ± member
-> Limit scope of constant to class 	= make it a member
* È·±£³£Á¿ÖÁ¶àÖ»ÓÐÒ»¸öÊµÌå£¬ÐèÒª¶¨ÒåÎª static ³ÉÔ±
-> Ensure at most one copy of constant 	= make it static

```
// GamePlayer.h
class GamePlayer
{
private:
	static const int NumTurns = 5;	// constant declaration ³£Á¿ÉùÃ÷
	int scores[NumTurns];	//Ê¹ÓÃ¸Ã³£Á¿
};
```

C++ requires definition for declaration except class-specific constants that are static of integral type
(int, char, bool)

NB: if you take address then compiler insists on definition:

```
// GamePlayer.cpp
const int GamePlayer::NumTurns; 	// definition	no value!
```

Cannot create class-specific constant using #define
```
#define does not respect scope: can't be private
```

If (old) compiler does not allow initialization in declaration (above) then do this
```
// GamePlayer.h
class GamePlayer
{
private:
	static const int NumTurns;	// constant declaration
								// ÔÚÍ·ÎÄ¼þÄÚ
};


// GamePlayer.cpp
const int GamePlayer::NumTurns = 5; 	// definition! 
//ÔÚÊµÏÖÎÄ¼þÖÐ
```

However, now scores array won't work 'cos you need the value of a class constant during compilation:
compilers insist on knowing the size of the array


### 2.3 Only way to forbid in-class specification of initial values for static integral class constants:
**ENUM HACK**
```
class GamePlayer
{
private:
  enum { NumTurns = 5 };        // "the enum hack" — makes NumTurns a symbolic name for 5
  int scores[NumTurns];         // fine
};
```
```
Enum hack used a lot!
Acts more like #define than const

Why?
Take address of const	Legal
Take address of enum	Illegal
Take address of #define	Illegal
```
If you don't want people get pointer or reference to integral constants then enum enforces that constraint

Also, enum hack is fundamental technique of template metaprogramming


MACROs

Macros look like functions but don't incur overhead of function call

Arrgh : must parenthesize all arguments in the macro body!

```
NO
// call f with the maximum of a and b
#define CALL_WITH_MAX(a, b) f((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))


int a = 5, b = 0;
CALL_WITH_MAX(++a, b);          // a is incremented twice
CALL_WITH_MAX(++a, b+10);       // a is incremented once

YES
//inline
template<typename T>
inline void callWithMax(const T& a, const T& b)
{
	f(a > b ? a : b);
}
```
```
No need to
parenthesize parameters inside function body
evaluate parameters multiple times

callWithMax obeys scope and access rules
Can inline function private to the class
Can't do that with Macro!
```
## SUMMARY
* For simple constants, prefer const or enums to #define
* For function-like macros, prefer inline functions to #define
